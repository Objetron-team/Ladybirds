# How does it work?
The robot has a BT module, we have encodded a series of actions.
```
b -> select the blue team
y -> select the yellow team

z -> start the sequence
s -> stop the sequence
n -> next move
```

![Diagram](https://github.com/Objetron-team/Ladybirds/blob/main/Pami.drawio.png)

The sequence is a predefined list of coordinate, a path is generated by a list of forward and rotation mouvement. The position of the pami is managed by two PID controller, for the distance made by the pami and its rotation. We can compute a target speed using the PIDs and the speed is fed to speed PID controller.
The pami stop when the goal is achieved or if an object is detected.
